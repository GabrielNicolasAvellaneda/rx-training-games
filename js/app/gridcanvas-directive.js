                // As far as I understand, there are multiple sources of events that trigger modifications in the layout :
                // spreadsheets applied by the browser, angular views, JavaScript libraries (e.g. codemirror)
                // Because of this, there is no easy way to know when the DOMÂ is completely loaded and rendered
                // See 'listener for view update completion' https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1306

                // the application is embedded in an iframe.
                // The only approach I could find so far is listening DOM modification events on the 'offsetWidth' property
