Developing using Reactive Extensions is possible in JavaScript thanks to
[RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc).

Features of
[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) and
[ECMAScript 6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/)
as used in the samples are suggested to make your code more concise.

If you prefer coding using your own editor you can
[build and run the code locally](https://github.com/JulienMoumne/rx-training-games#how-to-build-and-run-the-code-locally).
