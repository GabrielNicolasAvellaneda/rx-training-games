using Reactive Extensions.

**How to play**

This game is played differently than the others.

You can:

 - adjust the parameters of the algorithm to see how it behaves
 - implement an extension, e.g.
 [multiple colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant#Extension_to_multiple_colors),
 [multiple states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant#Extension_to_multiple_states),
