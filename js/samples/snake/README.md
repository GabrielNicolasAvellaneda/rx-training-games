The classical mobile game inspired by [A Playful Introduction to Rx by Erik Meijer](https://youtu.be/WKore-AkisY).

The original code written in Scala can be found [on slide 4](http://ecoop14.it.uu.se/programme/Rx.pdf).

**How to play**

Use the Left, Up, Right and Down arrows of your keyboard to help the snake catch some food.

It's game over when the snake walks over itself or leaves the screen.


**Limitations**

 - end of game is not implemented
 - food can appear on the snake
