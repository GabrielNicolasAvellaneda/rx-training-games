This snippet is what makes the snake move in the
[Snake game](https://julienmoumne.github.io/rx-training-games/#?title=snake).

This approach leverages the
[WithLatestFrom Operator](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/withlatestfrom.md).

Use the Left, Up, Right and Down arrows of your keyboard to move the snake.

The other snippets provide alternative approaches in case
[WithLatestFrom](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/withlatestfrom.md)
is not available in your Reactive Extensions implementation.
