This snippet is what makes the snake move in the
[Snake game](https://julienmoumne.github.io/rx-training-games/#?title=snake).

This approach is the one used in slide 4 of [A Playful Introduction to Rx by Erik Meijer](http://ecoop14.it.uu.se/programme/Rx.pdf).

It leverages the [Join operator](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/join.md).

Use the Left, Up, Right and Down arrows of your keyboard to move the snake.
